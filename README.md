# Single player TicTacToe with unbeatable AI

Implemented AI algorithms:

1. Precomputed moves (stored in a file, created with MinMax) - instant, optimal moves.
2. MinMax - the slowest, but optimal moves.
3. MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) with UCT (Upper Confidence Bound 1 applied to trees) - based on 100 random play outs (simulations), fast and playing optimal.
